## Things discovered

* [5 programming patterns I like](https://dev.to/thejohnstew/5-programming-patterns-i-like-53dp?utm_source=Newsletter+Subscribers&utm_campaign=58070690c5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_05_27_01_35&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_d8f11d5d1e-58070690c5-154926425)
    * Early exists [1]
        * also known as "Bouncer pattern" or "guard clauses"
        * checking for invalid use cases first
        * Pros:
            * encourages thinking around invalid/edge cases and how those cases should be handled
            * avoids accidental and unnecessary processing of code against an unexpected use case
            * mentally allows me to process each use case much more clearly
            * once adopted, you can quickly glance at functions and understand the flow and execution which typically follows a top down approach going from - invalid cases -> small cases -> expected case
        * [More to read](http://rikschennink.nl/thoughts/the-bouncer-pattern/)
    * Switch to object literal [2]
        * don't have to worry about case or break
        * easier to read and quickly understand what's happening
        * object literals are easy enough to write
        * less code
        * [More to read](https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/deprecating-the-switch-statement-for-object-literals)
    * One loop two arrays [3]
        * Don't like this that much
    * No 'foo' variables [4]
        * take the time and do your best to name something appropriately
        * Variable naming should be used to help explain and give context to what is going on within the code
        * [More to read](https://hackernoon.com/the-art-of-naming-variables-52f44de00aad)
    * Nested ternaries [5]
        * if and else are much easier to read as they are actual words but when these become nested I start to really have a hard time following what is going on and mentally keeping track of everything
        * his pattern is really up to you and your team and your preferences

* [The art of naming variables](https://hackernoon.com/the-art-of-naming-variables-52f44de00aad)
    * Arrays
        * bad: `const fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'cucumber'];`
        * great: `const fruitNames = ['apple', 'banana', 'cucumber'];`
    * Booleans
        * bad: `const open = true;`
        * good: `const isOpen = true`;
    * Booleans + Functions [6]
    * Numbers
        * bad: `const pugs = 3;`
        * good: `const minPugs = 3;`
    * Functions
        * bad: `userData(userId)`
        * good: `getUser(userId)`
