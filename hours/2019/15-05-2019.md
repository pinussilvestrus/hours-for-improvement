## Things discovered

* Read dev.to article about [What's new in Javascript](https://dev.to/pjijin/what-s-new-in-javascript-3lgj)?
    * Private Fields: allowing to create private variables in classes, just like in OOP languages as Java
    * Multiplying of Big Integers: `1234567890123456789n * 123n` will now work
    * Flatten arrays: `[1, 2, [3]].flat()` => `[1,  2,  3]`
    * Transform array to  objects and backwards by `Object.entries(object) => array` + `Object.fromEntries(array) => object`
