  * Types of streams: Writable, Readable, Duplex (r+w), Transform (modify duplex)
* [Playing around with streams](https://github.com/workshopper/stream-adventure/)
  * Different examples accessible via  CLI
  * `$ npm i -g stream-adventure`
  * `$ stream-adventure`
  * chose example [1]
  * get instructions for each example [2]
