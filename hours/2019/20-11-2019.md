## Things discovered

* [12 Factor Applications](https://12factor.net/)
    * Codebase: A codebase is any single repo (in a centralized revision control system like Subversion), or any set of repos who share a root commit 
    * Dependencies: A twelve-factor app never relies on implicit existence of system-wide packages.
    * Config: The twelve-factor app stores config in environment variables
    * Backing services: The code for a twelve-factor app makes no distinction between local and third party services.
    * Build, release, run: The twelve-factor app uses strict separation between the build, release, and run stages.
    * Processes: Twelve-factor processes are stateless and share-nothing
    * Port binding: The twelve-factor app is completely self-contained. The web app exports HTTP as a service by binding to a port.
    * Concurrency: In the twelve-factor app, processes are a first class citizen.
    * Disposability: The twelve-factor app’s processes are disposable, meaning they can be started or stopped at a moment’s notice
    * Dev/prod parity: The twelve-factor app is designed for continuous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small
    * Logs: A twelve-factor app never concerns itself with routing or storage of its output stream
    * Admin processes: Separately, developers will often wish to do one-off administrative or maintenance tasks for the app
