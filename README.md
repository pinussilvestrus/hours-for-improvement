# hours-for-improvement

This project is meant to document the weekly progress of the so called "Hours for Improvement" sessions. They take place to create new personal experiences in different topics, e.g. exploring new technologies, learn about software development techniques, or make learnings in the way of solving problems. After every session a short summary will be created with the things I discovered in the hours.

The Hours of Improvement are dealt inside the *Slack Time* due  my job [@Camunda](https://github.com/camunda).
